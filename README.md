# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project
This project was completed by John Brake here in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232,
Data Bootcamp, Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project.
In particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own.
The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for

Project Description:

Megafauna, like Elephants, Rhinoceros, or other giant animals have been inspiring zoologists and the general public for hundreds of year. They evoke wonder in anyone who looks upon them, and the groups largely vegetarian existence gives them the allure of a gentle giant. However, Megafauna populations all over the world are under siege.  Recently, their plight was brought to the forefront of global consciousness following the press surrounding the "Last Three Northern White Rhinoceros". There is great cause for concern. However, coinciding with these events, a breadth of tools for data analysis and visualization have come into existence, presenting an opportunity to present data to further illuminate the plight of these and other megafauna, hopefully inspiring action on their behalf. 

This project aims to gather important publically available data on the Loxodonta africana (African Elephant), Diceros bicornis (African Black Rhinoceros) and the Ceratotherium simum (African White Rhinoceros). This information will include their population classification over time, current population figures for Elephants, current geographic locations, and population threats. This project will also gather information about some of the legislative actions take to save these species from extinction. Through this data, this project hopes to illuminate the situation these megafauna are facing, and hopefully inspire action to help reverse the current trajectory.
