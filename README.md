# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project
This project was completed by John Brake here in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232,
Data Bootcamp, Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project.
In particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own.
The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative
expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing

or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.
I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for

Project Description:

Megafauna like Elephants and Rhinoceroses have been inspiring zoologists and the general public alike for hundreds of year. They evoke wonder in anyone who looks upon them, and the groups' largely vegetarian existence gives them the allure of a gentle giant. However, Megafauna populations all over the world are under siege.  Recently, their plight was brought to the forefront of global consciousness following the press surrounding the last three Northern White Rhinoceros. There is great cause for concern. However, coinciding with these events, a breadth of tools for data analysis and visualization have come into existence, presenting an opportunity to present to the public the plight of African Elephants and the Rhinoceroses. 

This project aims to gather important publicly available data on the Loxodonta africana (African Elephant), Diceros bicornis (African Black Rhinoceros) and the Ceratotherium simum (African White Rhinoceros). This information will include their population classification over time, current population estimates for Elephants, current geographic locations, and population threats. This project will also synthesize information regarding some of the legislative actions taken to save these species from extinction. Through this data, this project hopes to illuminate the dire situation of these megafauna, and in doing so, inspire action to reverse the current trajectory.
